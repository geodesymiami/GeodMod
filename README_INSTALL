%geodmod - geodetic modelling software
%Falk Amelung, University of Miami, March 2008
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%QUICK SUMMARY FOR DARWIN VOLCANO ONLY:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% from matlab command line:
localdir = pwd;
url      = 'http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/personal/famelung/geodmod/';
untar( [url 'geodmod.tgz'],    localdir);
untar( [url 'testdata_geodmod_darwin.tgz'],localdir);
tmp=dir(['geo*']);
geodmod_latest=tmp(end).name;
setenv('GEODMOD_HOME'     ,[localdir filesep geodmod_latest]);
setenv('GEODMOD_TESTDATA',[localdir filesep 'testdata_geodmod']);
disp('Setting paths for geodmod...');
run( [ getenv('GEODMOD_HOME') filesep 'addpath_geodmod'] );
geodmod Darwin.min
gclean all

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% if this was succesful complete the installation
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
disp('This testdata file is about 1 Gb..., please have patience')
untar( [url 'testdata_geodmod.tgz'],localdir);        % from matlab command line, gets the entire testdata set (1Gb)
test_geodmod 'all'

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The produced output should be similar to:

%modify the startup scripts:
0. Determine the geodmod version:
set geodmod_latest=`ls -dr geodmod* | head -1`

1. Add to your .cshrc:
setenv GEODMOD_HOME     ~/geodmod_latest      
setenv GEODMOD_TESTDATA ~/testdata_geodmod      
setenv TESTBENCH        ~/TEST

2. Add to your startup.m file: 
disp('Setting paths for geodmod...')
run( [ getenv('GEODMOD_HOME') filesep 'addpath_geodmod'] )

3. Test the installation:
 
test_geodmod
test_geodmod 'all'

%      Alternative from linux command line                     %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
FIRST STEP:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
You first need to untar the geodmod and sbas tar balls and the testdata
tar xvf geodmod.tgz
tar xvf sbas.tgz
tar xvf testdata_geodmod.tgz

(Note 1: tar xvf testdata_geodmod_darwin.tar if you have downloaded only the data for Darwin volcano)
(Note 2: the sbas.tgz ball has actually a different purpose. It includes some files that are currently
needed by geodmod. In furture versions these files will be directly included into geodmod)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
SECOND STEP:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Now you need to set the GEODMOD_HOME environment variable and run the function
addpath_geodmod. 

1. Add to your .cshrc:
setenv GEODMOD_HOME     ~/geodmod_version_3_2_2      
setenv GEODMOD_TESTDATA ~/testdata_geodmod      
setenv SBASHOME      ~/sbas_version_0_5      

2. Add to your startup.m file: 
disp('Setting paths for geodmod...')
run( [ getenv('GEODMOD_HOME') filesep 'addpath_geodmod'] )
run( [ getenv('SBASHOME')    filesep 'addpath_sbas'] )

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
THIRD STEP:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% test your geodmod distribution

 test_geodmod        
 test_geodmod 'all'
